                    A company built by five members from scratch who saw potential for 
                    'anime Industry' to grow in INDIA and worked for it.

                <h4>
                    5 weebs who came together to launch 'weebSauce' for India met at an 
                    online anime convention held in India. Their aspiration led them to 
                    go ahead and to make the anime community in India more stronger and 
                    reach its potential. But they couldn't do it at first and it took 
                    them about 2 years to get to this stage.

                <h1>Our Idea</h1>
                <h4>
                    In India, ‘anime’ series are catching a lot of eyes and love lately. 
                    Despite this, there has not been a single reliable source from which 
                    users can buy anime goodies or manga. Our purpose is to solve this 
                    issue and provide the audience with official merchandise and manga at 
                    a reasonable price. The reason why we are not only providing merchandise 
                    that are requested and going for the surprise factor is to present what 
                    anime can scale up to. In most of the cases, people who have just started 
                    watching anime, they try to stick to the popular series only (which is 
                    not a bad thing), but they tend to ignore all the new anime that the artists 
                    have put so much effort into making it.

                <h4>
                    A research was conducted by our crew members through social media 
                    polls and a web form to provide statistics to our statement. It was 
                    pushed to every major state in India including Punjab, Delhi, and 
                    Mumbai. This survey included questions from “what do you feel about 
                    anime?”, and “which anime have you watched?”. The results that we got 
                    from this were quite astonishing as about 80% of them knew what anime 
                    is but their perspective was only limited to these two anime series 
                    “Dragon Ball Z” and “Naruto” which narrowed their perspective for what 
                    anime could scale up to from being only a fun series to a dead serious 
                    mysterious ones. They also stated that they are interested in exploring 
                    this entertainment media but are restricted due to sub-par available 
                    options.

                <h1>How are we financing it?</h1>
                <h4>We have designed our project this way that it is not too difficult to 
                    financially support it. We have already gathered some of the original 
                    authors to sponsor our project while giving us some cut also as we 
                    will be helping their artwork to gain popularity at new speeds. All 
                    the goodies are ordered in bulk which leads to economics of scale, 
                    making this a profitable venture. When it comes to hosting the website 
                    for our service, we will be taking help from our instructor 
                    ‘Talia Harris’ who is allocating a Linux server for us to use as a 
                    remote server.
